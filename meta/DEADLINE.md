My app takes an input from the use, either country, city or both together and returns the best result of that combination as geographical coordinates.
Those coordinates are then passed into another Api that uses them to find the accurate weather, temperature and humidity at those coordinates.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned how to take inputs from Api's that output multiple arrays in one return statement.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would have started earlier and verified that the Api would work and was not faulty before working with it.
